## Problem

**Current State:** UI is cluttered with large blue header and prominent toolbar. QR code generation is broken with "Invalid type number" error.

**Root Problem:** Users want to focus on content, not UI chrome. The QR library is being called with invalid parameters.

---

## Outcome

Clean, minimal UI inspired by Excalidraw:
- Black/white color scheme (no blue)
- Hidden or minimal header
- Corner-positioned small buttons
- Full-viewport editor
- Working QR code generation

---

| R4 | Fix QR code typeNumber (use 0 for auto) | P0 |
